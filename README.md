# Birds
It's a website I made using Dora. It is a cutting-edge design platform that enables users to create stunning websites with intricate animations and interactive 3D elements. The unique thing about this platform is that it offers the unique ability to perform 3D interaction without any coding required. I made this website without writing a single line of code. I designed the layout in Figma and converted that into a web interface in the Dora platform using Figma to Dora plugin. It's not responsive yet for smaller screen sizes, it's only viewable on a desktop or laptop screen.
